### What I Know
This project is a multi-threaded **bank simulation** where 50 customers interact with 3 tellers. It involves synchronizing threads using semaphores in Python via the `threading` module. Each teller and customer is a thread. Shared resources like the **safe** (max 2 tellers), **manager** (1 teller), and **door** (2 customers at a time) must be protected using semaphores.

The program will simulate a real bank scenario:
- Customers choose to **deposit or withdraw**.
- Tellers must interact with **manager** (for withdrawals only) and then access the **safe** to complete transactions.
- The output must be **detailed logging of all actions**, showing both thread IDs and the action in progress.

Synchronization is critical here to ensure:
- No race conditions when multiple tellers interact with the manager or safe.
- Customers only enter when tellers are ready.
- Proper blocking and waking up when resources are busy.

### My Overall Plan
1. **Start small** â€” I'll begin with 3 tellers and maybe 3 customers to visualize output and get interaction structure down.
2. **Build incrementally**:
   - Phase 1: Setup basic threading and output formatting.
   - Phase 2: Customer-teller handshake (introductions and transaction communication).
   - Phase 3: Manager and safe interaction with semaphores.
   - Phase 4: Add constraints like max 2 customers in door, proper queueing, etc.
3. **Use Semaphores wisely** to prevent deadlocks. Each key part (manager, safe, teller-customer handshake, door) will likely need its own semaphore.
4. **Create a clean output log** that mirrors the format provided in the spec.
5. **Document all my findings and work** here in the devlog.

## Thoughts So Far:

This project simulates a bank environment with threading and semaphores. It involves three tellers and fifty customers, where synchronization is essential to manage access to shared resources: the bank manager, the safe, and the bank entrance. Only two customers can be in the bank at once, only two tellers can be in the safe at a time, and only one teller can talk to the manager at once.

Right now, the focus is just making sure the threading system is wired up and logging is working properly.

## Plan for This Session:

### Goal:
- Set up the initial Python project structure.
- Create a basic simulation with 3 teller threads and 5 customer threads.
- Ensure each thread prints an identifying message when it starts running.
- Verify that thread spawning, running, and joining works properly.

### Steps:
1. Create `main.py` and define teller and customer thread functions.
2. Spawn 3 teller threads, each with a unique ID.
3. Spawn 5 customer threads (starting small for testing).
4. Each thread prints a formatted line like: `"Customer 1 [Teller 0]: selects teller"`.
5. Confirm all threads run and complete execution without issue.
